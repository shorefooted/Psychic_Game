    /*
    1.) app randomly picks a letter -- keeps hidden
        random number generator for the computer – stored in a var
        1.1) create a variable that holds the letters of the alphabet
        1.2) generate a random number between 0-25 which is going to be the index of a random letter from the alphabet array.
        1.3) store the selected letter in a variable

            1.A.) create variables to keep track of the game stats. like:
                - user’s correct wins (correctly guessed letters)
                - user’s losses (incorreclt guessed letters with no guesses remaining)
                - total guesess per game, letters user has guessed during game

    2.) User guesses which letter the app has chosen
        2.1) user presses a key and key guess is displayed
        2.2) get key pressed
        2.3) lowercase the key
        2.4) validate that the user presses a letter
        2.5) Check that the user has guesses left

    3.) check the users key value against the computer's selected letter
        3.1) if correct wins go up by 1, reset all varaible except wins and losses let user know they win
        3.2) if incorrect reduce the guess count by 1; add guessed letter to letters guessed array; let user know to try again
       
    4.)  user out of guesses
        4.1) let user know they lost
        4.2) reset all varaible except wins and losses  */
